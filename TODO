# General

• TODO: Use Faithful 32x for buttons, backgrounds and font (or use Minecraftia for the latter)
   → Will require a fully-featured texture pack system
   → It’s better to do this feature as a big PR

# Issues

• TODO: GUI scale issues
   ◦ TODO: `HUD` doesn’t update when GUI scale is changed
   ◦ TODO: `SettingsMenuState` should update scaling when the setting is changed
◦ TODO: Trees should block light
• TODO: Blocks can be accessed from outside the world (will need a refactoring)
• TODO: Collisions are fucked up with blocks placed at `x = -1` from `x = 0`

# Refactorings

• TODO: Add a mesh system, either here or in `GameKit`
   → Maybe this is the way to add custom vertex attributes while having default ones? Check 3dee
   → Or maybe it would be better to use a VAO in `GameKit`

# Menus

• TODO: World selection menu

# World
