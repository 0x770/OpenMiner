• TODO: Blocks can be placed inside the player (check for AABB?)
• TODO: Sometimes it’s possible to aim between two blocks and right-clicking will replace one

# Code improvements

• DONE: Pass `ClientCommandHandler` instead of `Client` in the game (for example in `BlockCursor`)
   → DONE: This will allow to send network commands via a single function
   → DONE: The code won’t be replicated anymore
   → DONE: Packages musn’t be send from another place than `ClientCommandHandler`
• TODO: Use `ServerCommandHandler` instead of `Server` (cf. above)

• TODO: Unify cube coords in `BlockCursor`, `Cube`, `ChunkBuilder`

# Refactorings

• TODO: Add a mesh system, either here or in `GameKit`
   → Maybe this is the way to add custom vertex attributes while having default ones? Check 3dee
   → Or maybe it would be better to use a VAO in `GameKit`

# GUI

   ◦ TODO: Add a `ProgressBarWidget` and find how to make it communicate between client and server
